  <title>Vector and Inner Product Spaces</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> This chapter explores linear systems in a more abstract manner.  We
      will see that framing vector and matrix addition and scalar multiplication
      in a more general way will allow us to make connections between
      seemingly disparate parts of mathematics and then discover new
      things because of this.   </p>

      <p>We first investigate vector spaces, which at first seem like
        they are just sets of vectors, but are actually much more.
        Then we will see inner product spaces, another way of looking
        at vectors and finally linear transformations.
       </p>
