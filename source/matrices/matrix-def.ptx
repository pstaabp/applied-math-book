			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular grid of numbers.
					An <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrix has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			For example,
			<men xml:id="eq-example-matrix">
				\begin{bmatrix}
				1 \amp 2 \amp 11 \amp -1 \\ 3 \amp -2 \amp 3 \amp 4
				\end{bmatrix}
			</men>
		</p>

		<p>
			The <term>size</term> of a matrix is the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
			The number of rows is listed first.
			The size of the example above is 2 by 4.
		</p>

		<p>
			The numbers in a matrix are called the <term>entries</term> or <term>elements</term> of the matrix.
			For example, for the matrix in
			<xref ref="eq-example-matrix" />, the entry on the first row and third
			column is 11.
			Often we will use the notation <m>a_{1,3} = 11</m>,
			where the subscript 1 is the row number and <m>3</m> is the column number.

		<title>Vectors</title>
		<p>
			We saw vectors in <xref ref="ch-linear-systems"/> however we repeat some of these to put them in a
			broader context.
		</p>

		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>vector</term> is a matrix with one of its dimensions is 1.
					If a matrix only has
					one column it is called a <term>column vector</term>.
					If the matrix has only one row it is called a
					a <term>row vector</term>.
					The number of elements (numbers) in the vector is called the <term>length</term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			As we investigate matrices, since vectors are in fact matrices, the properties will hold
			for vectors as well.

		<title>Matrix, Vector and Scalar Notation</title>
		<p>
			A <term>scalar</term> is a fancy term for a number.
			Mathematicians use
			this term to distinguish them from matrices and vectors, which are not
			scalars.
			Whenever variables are used for scalars, then lower case
			letters will be used.
			For example, <m>a, n</m> and <m>x</m> are scalar
			variables.
		</p>

		<p>
			When we use variable names for matrices, we will use capital letters.
			For example, <m>A, B</m> and <m>X</m> are matrix (or vector) variables.
		</p>

		<p>
			Often, vectors will be lower case with an arrow on top.
			For example, here are vectors:
			<m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{x}</m>.
		</p>

		<remark>
			<p>
				In general, a matrix <m>A</m> can be written <m>[a_{ij}]</m>.
				These will be used in proofs later on in
				this chapter and for defintions of operations.
				A vector <m>\vec{v}</m> can be written <m>[v_i]</m> and
				although this notation can be used for both column and row vectors, unless denoted as such vectors will
				be consider as column vectors.
				We will see later in this chapter that we can simply write a row vector
				as a transformation of a column vector.
