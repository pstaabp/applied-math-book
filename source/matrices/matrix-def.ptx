      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular grid of numbers.
          An <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrix has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For example,
      <men xml:id="eq-example-matrix">
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 11 \amp -1 \\ 3 \amp -2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <term>size</term> of a matrix is the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
      The number of rows is listed first.
      The size of the example above is 2 by 4.
    </p>

    <p>
      The numbers in a matrix are called the <term>entries</term> or <term>elements</term> of the matrix.
      For example, for the matrix in <xref ref="eq-example-matrix" />, the entry on the first row and third column is 11.
      Often we will use the notation <m>a_{1,3} = 11</m>, where the subscript 1 is the row number and <m>3</m> is the column number.

  <subsection xml:id="sect-vectors">
    <title>Vectors</title>

    <p>
      We saw vectors in <xref ref="ch-linear-systems"/> however we repeat some of these to put them in a broader context.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector</term> is a matrix with one of its dimensions is 1.
          If a matrix only has one column it is called a <term>column vector</term>.
          If the matrix has only one row it is called a a <term>row vector</term>.
          The number of elements (numbers) in the vector is called the <term>length</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The following are examples of vectors.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The first two are column vectors.
          The third is a row vectors.
          <me>
            \begin{aligned} \boldsymbol{u} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \amp \boldsymbol{v} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 110 \\ 25 \\ 150 \end{bmatrix} \amp \boldsymbol{w} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \amp 4 \amp -2 \end{bmatrix} \end{aligned}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Since a vector has a single dimension, the individual elements can be identified with a single index.
      For example, <m>v_2 = -1 </m> and <m>w_3 = -2</m>.
      The lengths of <m>\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}</m> and <m>\boldsymbol{w}</m>  are 4,3 and 3 respectively.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Vectors can be thought of as individual columns or rows of a matrix.
        Also, a column vector can be thought of as an <m>m \times 1</m> matrix and a row vector as a <m>1 \times n</m> matrix and properties of matrices will pertain to vectors as well.

    <title>Matrix, Vector and Scalar Notation</title>

    <p>
      A <term>scalar</term> is a fancy term for a number.
      Mathematicians use this term to distinguish them from matrices and vectors, which are not scalars.
      Whenever variables are used for scalars, then lower case letters will be used.
      For example, <m>a, n</m> and <m>x</m> are scalar variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we use variable names for matrices, we will use capital letters.
      For example, <m>A, B</m> and <m>X</m> are matrix (or vector) variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, vectors will be lower case and bold.
      For example, here are vectors: <m>\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}, \boldsymbol{x}</m>.
			Note: sometimes vectors are indicated with a arrow above the variable name, like <m>\vec{v}</m>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        In general, a matrix <m>A</m> can be written <m>[a_{ij}]</m>.
        These will be used in proofs later on in this chapter and for defintions of operations.
        A vector <m>\boldsymbol{v}</m> can be written <m>[v_i]</m> and although this notation can be used for both column and row vectors, unless denoted as such vectors will be consider as column vectors.
        We will see later in this chapter that we can simply write a row vector as a transformation of a column vector.
