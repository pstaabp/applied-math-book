	<title>Partial Differential Equations</title>

	<introduction>
		<p> Partial differential equations (or PDEs) are very common in modeling many
			physical phenomena including understanding wave propagation, heat transport,
			and the motion of fluids as just a limited selection of examples.   We will derive
			equations for some simple examples in the section using conservation from physics. </p>
<p>
			Before getting to the derivation and solution of PDEs, we need to review and introduce a few concepts.  </p>
