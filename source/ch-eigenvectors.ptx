  <title>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> There is another very important aspect to linear algebra that will play
      a very important role in applied mathematics.  This is the notion of an
      eigenvector and eigenvalue. Briefly, these are a vector and scalar in
      an equation, however, first, there is a strong geometric role behind
      them and secondly, eigenvectors and eigenvalues play an important role
      in many parts of linear algebra.  Lastly, we will see an extension of
      them for functions later in the text.   </p>
