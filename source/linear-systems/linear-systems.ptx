	<title>Linear Systems</title>
	<p>
		We start this section with three examples of linear systems.
		One is about
		a biathlon with running and biking legs, the second is a traffic model and the last one is
		an example from chemistry.
		Examples of linear systems are found from every
		mathematical subfield and every science.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="ex-biathlon">
		<title>Biathlon Example</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Set up the following problem as a set of linear equations.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Travis runs 6 mph and bikes 18 mph in a race with two events.
				If the course is 29 miles long and it takes him 2 hours and 10 minutes
				to complete the race, how long is each segment?</em>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				In this case, we need to know how long each segment is.
				There are two legs to the race, so we will let
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> x_1 \amp = \text{number of miles for the run,}</mrow>
					<mrow> x_2 \amp = \text{number of miles for the bike.} </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				The equations come from three statements in the problem above.
				First, we know that the total course is 29 miles long or
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					x_1+x_2=29.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				The remaining equation arises from the time it takes Travis to complete the race.
				In general recall the relationship between speed (a rate), distance and time is
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				or solving for time,
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\text{time} =\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the time it takes Travis to finish the running leg is <m>x_1/6</m>.
				The total
				time in hours it takes Travis to finish the race is
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\frac{x_1}{6} + \frac{x_2}{18} = 2+ \frac{10}{60} = \frac{13}{6}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				so the linear system is

	<p>
		The next two examples give a way to determine if a point or <m>n</m>-tuple is a solution to a
		linear system.
	</p>

	<example>
		<title>Showing a Point is a Solution to a Linear System</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Show that the point <m>(2,3)</m> is a solution of the linear system:
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>3x_1 - x_2 \amp = 3 </mrow>
					<mrow>2x_1 + 4x_2 \amp = 16 </mrow>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Substitute <m>x_1=2</m> and <m>x_2=3</m> into both equations and check.

					<mrow>3(2) - 3 \amp = 3, </mrow>
					<mrow>2(2) + 4(3) \amp = 16.
					</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Since each equation is satisfied at the point <m>(2,3)</m> is a solution to the linear
				system.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Recall that the linear system in Example <xref ref="ex-hydrazine" /> can be written:
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>k_1 \phantom{+2k_2}- 2k_3\phantom{+2k_4} \amp = 0, </mrow>
					<mrow>2k_2 + 2k_3 -2k_4 \amp = 0, </mrow>
					<mrow>2k_2 \phantom{+2x_3}- k_4 \amp = 0, </mrow>

			</p>

			<p>
				Is <m>(8,4,4,8)</m> a solution to this linear system? Is <m>(4,2,2,4)</m>? Is <m>
				(6,1,3,2)</m>?
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				For <m>(8,4,4,8)</m>, we need to substitute this point in and check all the equations:
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>8-2(4) \amp = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow>2(4)+2(4)-2(8) \amp = 8+8-16 = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow>2(4)-8 \amp = 8-8 = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				so it is a solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				For <m>(4,2,2,4)</m>, again check all of the equations:
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>4-2(2) \amp = 0, </mrow>
					<mrow>3(4)+2(2)-4(2)-2(4) \amp = 12+4-8-8=0, </mrow>
					<mrow>2(2)-4\amp = 0</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				so this is also a solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				For <m>(6,1,3,2)</m>, we substitute this into the equation:
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>6-2(3) \amp = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow>3(6)+2(1)-4(3)-2(2) \amp = 18+2-12-4 = 4 \neq 0.
					</mrow>
					<mrow>2(1) - 2 \amp = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				and it satisfies 2 of the equations, but not all, so this is not a solution.

				</md>

			<p>

				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that the last equation in the last linear system contains no information.
				zero equals

				We all knew that before.
				We ignore that equation.
				The 2nd equation can be solved to

			</p>

			<p>
				eliminate the <m>x_2</m> term in the 3rd equation
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>3R_2+11R_3 \rightarrow R_3, \qquad \amp \amp 3x_1 + 4 x_2 \amp = 7, </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp\amp -11x_2 \amp = -44, </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp\amp 0x_2 \amp = -66,</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				And note in this case, that the last equation says <m>0=-66</m>, which is not true.
				Therefore, this means that there is no solution.
				This is in contrast to the the previous
				example, which did have a solution.
			</p>

			<remark>
				<title>Can solutions to linear system only be none or a unique solution?</title>
				<p>
					In the last example of this section, we will see that we can have many
					solutions to a linear system.
					If we have the following linear system
					already in echelon form:
				</p>

				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> x_1\phantom{+2x2} -2x_3\phantom{+x_4} \amp = 0, </mrow>
						<mrow>2x_2 +2x_3 -2x_4 \amp = 0, </mrow>
						<mrow>-2x_3 + x_4 \amp = 0,</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					Notice that since there are 4 variables and 3 equations, that there is no way to get a
					solution for <m>x_4</m> by itself (or any of the other 3 variables).
					This has many
					(actually infinitely many) solutions.
					For example <m>(0,0,0,0)</m> is one as well as <m>
					(2,1,1,2)</m> and <m>(-5,-5/2,-5/2,-5)</m>.
					We will explore this is much more detail
					later.

				As discussed above, this linear system has more that one solution.
				Therefore it is the set of points that satisfy every one of the original
				three equations or
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\{ (x,y,z)\; | \; x+2z=-6, \; 2x-y = 1, \; y+4z =-13\}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				However (and this is the main point of Gauss' method), using row
				operations, any points that satisfy the 3rd system above is also a
				solution, that is
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\{ (x,y,z) \; | \; x + 2z = -6, \; -y-4z = 13 \}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				This may be an improvement because there are only 2 equations
				instead of 3, but it's still difficult to write down a point that
				is in the solution set.
			</p>

			<p>
				Alternatively, we return to the last linear system and solve the 2nd equation for <m>y</m>
				or
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					y = -4z-13
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				and solving the first equation for <m>x</m> in the linear system above to get
			</p>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>x+2z \amp = -6 \qquad\qquad\text{or}</mrow>
					<mrow>x \amp = -2z -6 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				And now if we know <m>z</m>, we can find <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, thus we can write the
				solution set as
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					\{ (x,y,z) = (-2z-6, -4z-13,z) \; | \; z \in \mathbb{R} \}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				and now we have a lot of information about the solution set.
				For example, if <m>z=0</m>,
				then <m>x=-6, y=-13</m>, so the point <m>(-6,-13,0)</m> is in the solution set.
				Similarly if <m>
				z=-3</m>, then <m>(0,-1,-3)</m> is also a point in the solution set and any point given a
				value of <m>z</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also have a sense of the number of solutions and since <m>z</m> can take on any real
				number, there are an infinite number of triples <m>3</m>-tuples in this solution set.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, the form of the solution set above is in <em>set builder</em> form.
				That is is shows
				how to create the set of points in the solution.
			</p>

			<definition>
				<statement>
					<p>
						The non-leading variables in a linear system in echelon form are called the <term>free
						variables</term> or <term>parameters</term>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				The next example shows that a linear system can have more than one free variables.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="ex-echelon-form-3by5-soln">
				<statement>
					<p>
						In Example <xref ref="ex-echelon-form-3by5" />, we saw the following linear system

					</p>

					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>x_1\phantom{+2x_3} + 3x_3 -9 x_4 + 11 x_5 \amp = 14, </mrow>
							<mrow>2x_3 \phantom{-9x_4} +\phantom{1} 4x_5 \amp = 10, </mrow>
							<mrow>3x_5 \amp = 27,</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						Write the solution set in terms of the free variables.
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						First, we use back substitution to solve for the <em>leading variables</em>.
						The third
						equation states that <m>x_5 = 9</m>, and then substitute this into the 2nd equation:
					</p>

					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>2x_3 +4(9) \amp = 10,\qquad\quad \text{or} </mrow>
							<mrow>x_3 \amp = -13,</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						and then substitute into the first equation
					</p>

					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>x_1 + 3(-13) - 9 x_4 + 11 (9) \amp = 14 \quad\quad\text{or}</mrow>
							<mrow>x_1 \amp = 9x_4 - 46</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						Lastly, we write the solution in terms of <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> which are the two
						free variables.
					</p>

					<p>
						<me>
							\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = (9x_4-46,x_2,-13,x_4,9) \; | \; x_2, x_4 \in \mathbb{R}\}
						</me>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				We now find the solution to the Hydrazine chemistry problem in <xref ref="ex-hydrazine" />

					</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						In this case, we will use Gauss's method to put the linear system in echelon form:

					<p>

							<mrow>\amp \amp -2k_3 + k_4 \amp = 0,</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						which is now in echelon form.
						We now use back substitution to solve for <m>k_1</m>, <m>
						k_2</m> and <m>k_3</m>, the leading variables:
					</p>

					<p>
						<me>
							k_3 = \frac{1}{2} k_4 \\

						<me>
							k_2 = -k_3 + k_4 = - \frac{1}{2} k_4 + k_4 = \frac{1}{2} k_4,

					<p>
						and finally,

					<p>
						<me>
							k_1 = 2k_3 = 2 \biggl( \frac{1}{2} k_4 \biggr) = k_4
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Since <m>k_1, k_2</m> and <m>k_3</m> all depend on <m>k_4</m>, a free variable, there

			</example>

			<p>
				Since the above example comes from Chemical equations, it is desirable to find a solution
				of all positive integers, since the number represent the number of atoms in the reaction.
				In
				addition, typically the solution with smallest integers is desired.
				In this case, the
				solution <m>(2,1,1,2)</m> results in the following equation:
				<me>
					2 NH_3 + H_2O_2 \rightarrow N_2 H_4 + 2 H_2 O

	As you can see from the previous section solving linear systems require being very organized and
	not making any arithmetic errors.
	In this section, we will see how to solve linear systems using
	WebCAS, a computer program designed to learn row operations and the Gauss-Jordon method.
	WebCAS is found at \url{http://webwork.fitchburgstate.edu/webcas} and you need a modern web browser
	to use it.
	You should also see the website above for video and help pages on how to use WebCAS
	to solve linear systems.
	As often, its easier to show you, then to tell you how to use a
	computer program.
