  <title>Vectors and Matrices</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The previous section discussed linear equations, linear systems and a method to attempt to
      solve them.   As we noted the variables themselves played no role in the solution, however the coefficients
      of the    variables clearly did. In this section, we examine the main two structures of linear algebra,
      vectors and   matrices. </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m></title>

    <p>Let's start simple and with something we know. The notation <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is the set of
      all real numbers. It is often drawn as </p>

          \begin{tikzpicture}
          \draw[<->,very thick](-3,0) -- (3,0);

          \foreach \x in {-2,-1,...,2} {\draw (\x,-0.1) -- (\x,0.1) node [at start, below] {$\x$};}

    <p> and we use the number line to help with a number of mathematical concepts. For example, <m>3
      + 2</m> means start at the point <m>3</m> and go 2 spaces to the right (positive direction).
      The point of this is that there is direction and magnitude on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Alternative Definition of a Vector</title>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>vector</term> is a mathematical object with a magnitude and a direction. </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p> In <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, for two points, the vector between them is the distance between the
      point with the direction (left as negative and right as positive). </p>

    <p> In <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, vectors are often drawn as </p>

          \begin{tikzpicture}
          \draw [->] (-4,0) -- (4,0);
          \draw [->] (0,-4) -- (0,4);
          \foreach \x in {-3,-2,-1,1,2,3} {\draw (\x,-0.1) -- (\x,0.1) node [at start, below] {$\x$};}
          \foreach \y in {-3,-2,-1,1,2,3} {\draw (-0.1,\y) -- (0.1,\y) node [at start, left] {$\y$};}
          \draw [->,very thick] (0,0) -- (3,2);
          \draw [->,very thick] (-3,-1) -- (0,1);
          \draw [->, very thick] (2,-1) -- (2,-2);

          ]]>

    <p>with the magnitude being the length of the arrow and the direction as the
      angle (typically from the positive horizontal axis). </p>

    <p>The left 2 vectors above are identical above because the have the same
      magnitude and direction. That is the origin does not matter. </p>

    <p> To connect these concepts with that of vectors that we saw in <xref ref="sect-matrices-vectors" />
      above, we saw that the two different vectors in the plot above are <md>
        <mrow>\begin{bmatrix}
          3 \\ 2
          \end{bmatrix} \amp\amp\amp \begin{bmatrix}
          0 \\ -1
          \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
      </md> and as we will see that this formulation is much easier
      that writing down a vectors as a length and an angle. </p>

    <title>Vectors, Free Vectors and Points</title>

    <p> As noted above, vectors by definition have only a direction and magnitude which is why two
      of the vectors in the figure above are equal. Often, to clarify that the source point of the
      vector does not matter, the term <term>free vector</term> is used. However, generally, unless
      indicated a vector is a free vector.</p>

    <p>One case where a vector has a fixed point is when the source point is the origin. For
      example: </p>

    <p>The vector starts at the origin and the end point is at the point <m>(2,1)</m>. This vector
      is </p>

      <me> \vec{v} =

    <p> and the vector and the end point are identical. This can be very handy in many cases as we will we see. </p>
