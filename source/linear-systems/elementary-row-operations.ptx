	<introduction>
		<p>
			We now seek a method to solve the above linear systems (and any linear system).
			Gauss'
			method and variations of it are the standard ways that all large linear systems are solved
			presently.
			The next section shows how to systematically solve a linear system using rules of
			algebra that keep linear equations linear.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the following example of two linear equations:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-ex-lin-sys-1">x+2y+3z \amp =6 </mrow>
				<mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-ex-lin-sys-2">-2x+3y-z \amp =4 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			We seek to find operations on these equations that keep these equations linear and
			don't change the solution.
			First, the order that we wrote them down doesn't matter
			and we could swap these equations as in:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>-2x+3y-z \amp =4 </mrow>
				<mrow>x+2y+3z \amp =6 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			The second possible operation is to multiply a single equation by a constant.
			For example,
			if we multiply the first equation of <xref ref="eq-ex-lin-sys-1" /> by 2, we get the system:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>2x+4y+6z \amp =12 </mrow>
				<mrow>-2x+3y-z \amp =4 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			The third operation is that we can add two equations and the replace one of the equations
			with the sum.
			For example adding <xref ref="eq-ex-lin-sys-1"/> and
			<xref ref="eq-ex-lin-sys-2"/> and putting the sum in the 2nd row results in
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x+2y+3z \amp =6 </mrow>
				<mrow>-x+5y+2z \amp =10 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			A more common operation is to combine the last two operations and that is to multiply an equation
			by a constant and add to another.
			If we multiply <xref ref="eq-ex-lin-sys-1"/> by 2 and add to
			<xref ref="eq-ex-lin-sys-2"/> we get the system:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x+2y+3z \amp =6 </mrow>
				<mrow>7y + 5z \amp = 16 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

	<subsection xml:id="sect-gauss-method" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
		<title>Gauss's Method</title>
		<p>
			The following example shows how to use the elementary row operations seen above to
			solve a linear system with a technique called <em>Gauss's	Method</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x -2y + 3z \amp = 6, </mrow>
				<mrow>2x + 2y\phantom{+3z} \amp = 6, </mrow>
				<mrow>-3x \phantom{+2y}+\phantom{3} z \amp = 0.
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			If one equation had only one variable, it would be quite easy to find the solution to that
			equation.
			The following steps will result in such a system.
			For example, if the first equation
			is multiplied by <m>-2</m> and added to the second equation and the second equation is
			replaced (which we denote with <m>-2R_1+R_2 \rightarrow R_2</m>), then the above equations are
			replaced with
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\amp \amp x -2y + 3z \amp = 6, </mrow>
				<mrow>-2R_1+R_2 \rightarrow R_2\qquad\amp \amp 6 y-6z \amp = -6, </mrow>
				<mrow>\amp \amp -3x \phantom{+2y}+\phantom{3} z \amp = 0.</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, we'd like to get rid of the <m>x</m> term in the 3rd equation.
			We can do that by multiplying the first equation by 3 and adding to the 3rd and writing down this operation as
			well we get:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\amp \amp x -2y + \phantom{1}3z \amp = 6, </mrow>
				<mrow>3R_1+R_3 \rightarrow R_3\quad \amp \amp 6 y-\phantom{1}6z \amp = -6, </mrow>
				<mrow>\amp \amp -6y+10z \amp = 18.</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Next we will eliminate the <m>y</m> term in the 3rd equation.
			We can do that by adding
			equations 2 and 3 and putting the result in equation 3.
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \amp x -2y + 3z \amp = 6, </mrow>
				<mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq-gauss-method">R_2+R_3 \rightarrow R_3\quad \amp \amp 6 y-6z
				\amp =
				-6 </mrow>
				<mrow>\amp \amp 4z \amp = 12.
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point we can solve for <m>z</m> in the third equation of <xref ref="eq-gauss-method" />
			to get <m>z=3</m>.
			From this, plug in <m>z=3</m> into the second equation of <xref ref="eq-gauss-method" /> to get
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>6y -6(3) \amp = -6 </mrow>
				<mrow>6y \amp = 12 </mrow>
				<mrow>y \amp = 2</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			and finally we can use <m>z=3</m> and <m>y=2</m> to substitute into the first equation of <xref
			ref="eq-gauss-method" /> to get
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x-2(2)+3(3)\amp = 6 </mrow>
				<mrow>x-4+9\amp = 6 </mrow>
				<mrow>x \amp = 1</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			therefore, <m>x=1</m>.
			The point <m>(1,2,3)</m> is a solution to linear system.
			Because this
			is the only point that satisfies all equations, this point is <em>unique</em>.
			We will also
			use the terminology triple to describe <m>(1,2,3)</m>.

					Let <m>(s_1,s_2, \ldots, s_n)</m> be a solution of (<m>A</m>) if it exists and note it
					may be one of many <m>n</m>-tuples in the solution.
					Thus it satisfies each equation of
					linear system (<m>A</m>).
					Since the exact same equations are in (<m>B</m>) in just a
					different order, <m>(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n)</m> is a solution to (<m>B</m>).
					If there is more than one <m>n</m>-tuple in the solution to (<m>A</m>), repeat this for every one.
					If there is no solution to (<m>A</m>), then there will be no solution to (<m>B</m>) since it is the same

					by first writing as an augmented coefficient matrix and then performing elementary row

						It appears that there is only one line.
						This is because both lines have the same graph.
						Each point on the line is a solution to the linear system and since there are an
						infinite number of such points, this is an example of a linear system with <term>infinite
						number of solutions</term>.

			You can see if you have two lines, each with two variables, the example in <xref
			ref="eq-linear-system-geom1" /> is what happens if the two slopes are different.
			In this
			case, there is one (or a <term>unique</term>) solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the other two cases as in equations <xref ref="eq-linear-system-geom2" /> and
			<xref ref="eq-linear-system-geom3" />, both sets of lines have the same slope.
			In the case of <xref ref="eq-linear-system-geom2" /> the lines have different <m>y</m>-intercepts, and therefore
			the lines are parallel and thus there is <term>no solution</term> to the linear system.
			In the case of <xref ref="eq-linear-system-geom3" />, both the slope and <m>y</m>-intercepts are
			equal, so the lines are equal and thus any point on the line is a solution, and this system
			has an <term>infinite number of solutions</term>.
